<h2>
About the Tech:
</h2>


<p>

Using bleeding-edge frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Swift+Vapor/Kitura, Node JS, Python+Django, VueJS + Heroku/AWS/Azure/GoogleCloud.

Know this: we focus on the best and most powerful technology to use NOW. 
Not yesterday, not last year. This flexibility and
never-ceasing learning practice on our part makes it so you get the best of the best.

</p>

<p>
Huge companies like Google, Youtube, and Twitter use the same web frameworks we use as a 
primary development toolkit. <br/> 

You're probably familiar with website builders like wix or wordpress. 
The big problem with these is what's under the hood - and making sure your site is found. 

<br/>Google finds high-tech websites more efficiently. 
This is why it is important to use modern technologies as they evolve.
